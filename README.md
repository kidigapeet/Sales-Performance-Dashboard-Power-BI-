# 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built in Power BI Desktop. The primary goal of this lab was to utilize built-in visuals and automatic data aggregations to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights without the use of complex DAX formulas or data transformation.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
* **Data Integration:** Successfully loaded Excel datasets directly into Power BI.
* **Visual Selection:** Chose appropriate charts (Donut, Bar, Line, Cards) to represent different data dimensions.
* **Interactivity:** Implemented dynamic Slicers to allow users to filter by Region, Product Category, and Date.
* **Reporting:** Published the final report to the Power BI Service for cloud-based accessibility.

1.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, and Average Unit Price.
2.  **Geographical Analysis:** Sales performance broken down by Region and Country.
3.  **Product Insights:** Revenue by Product Category and a "Top 5 Products" filtered list.
4.  **Temporal Trends:** Monthly sales trends over time using the built-in date hierarchy.
5.  **Salesperson Performance:** Productivity tracking by Units Sold.
